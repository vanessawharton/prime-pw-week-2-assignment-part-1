// 12 - Create a constant variable called `allowedPets` and set it to a number value of your choice
// 13 - Create a conditional: if adventurous is true, console log "Adventures are great!", 
// if it's not true, console log "How about we stay home?"
// 14 - Create a compound conditional: if luckyNumber is 2 and adventurous is true,
// console log "Roll the dice!"
// 15 - Write a conditional that console logs "I can have more pets!" 
//if the value of `pets` is less than the value of `allowedPets`,
// console logs "I have enough pets" if the value of `pets` is equal to the value of `allowedPets`,
// and console logs "Oh no, I have too many pets!"
// if the value of `pets` is greater than the value of `allowedPets`.
// STRETCH GOALS:
// 16 - Make a variable called `mostPets` and a conditional that
// correctly checks the `pets` and `friendsPets` variables, and
// assigns the highest value to `mostPets`. There's several possibilities --
// be sure to think through all the scenarios. 
// console.log `mostPets` after the conditional has run.
// 17 - Write a *switch* statement that logs:
//      "First is the worst" if your lucky number is 1
//      "Second is the best" if your lucky number is 2
//      "Third is the one with the polka dot dress" if your lucky number is 3
//      Otherwise, log "Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity"
//      You'll need to research how to use switch statements!
// 18 -- Rewrite question 13 with a `ternary` operator. You'll need to do research!
